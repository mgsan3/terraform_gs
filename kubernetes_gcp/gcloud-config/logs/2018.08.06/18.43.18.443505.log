[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    [1mgcloud compute firewall-rules update[m is used to update firewall rules that
    allow/deny incoming/outgoing traffic. The firewall rule will only be
    updated for arguments that are specifically passed. Other attributes will
    remain unaffected. The [1maction[m flag (whether to allow or deny matching
    traffic) cannot be defined when updating a firewall rule; use [1mgcloud
    compute firewall-rules delete[m to remove the rule instead.

[m[1mPOSITIONAL ARGUMENTS[m
     [4mNAME[m
        Name of the firewall rule to update.

[m[1mFLAGS[m
     [1m--allow[m=[[4mPROTOCOL[m[:[4mPORT[m[-[4mPORT[m]],...]
        A list of protocols and ports whose traffic will be allowed.

        The protocols allowed over this connection. This can be the
        (case-sensitive) string values [1mtcp[m, [1mudp[m, [1micmp[m, [1mesp[m, [1mah[m, [1msctp[m, or any IP
        protocol number. An IP-based protocol must be specified for each rule.
        The rule applies only to specified protocol.

        For port-based protocols - [1mtcp[m, [1mudp[m, and [1msctp[m - a list of destination
        ports or port ranges to which the rule applies may optionally be
        specified. If no port or port range is specified, the rule applies to
        all destination ports.

        The ICMP protocol is supported, but there is no support for configuring
        ICMP packet filtering by ICMP code.

        For example, to create a rule that allows TCP traffic through port 80
        and ICMP traffic:

            $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --allow tcp:80,icmp

        To create a rule that allows TCP traffic from port 20000 to 25000:

            $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE \
                --allow tcp:20000-25000

        To create a rule that allows all TCP traffic:

            $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --allow tcp

    Setting this will override the current values.

     [1m--description[m=[4mDESCRIPTION[m
        A textual description for the firewall rule. Set to an empty string to
        clear existing.

     [1m--destination-ranges[m=[[4mCIDR_RANGE[m,...]
        The firewall rule will apply to traffic that has destination IP address
        in these IP address block list. The IP address blocks must be specified
        in CIDR format:
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing.

        Setting this will override the existing destination ranges for the
        firewall. The following will clear the existing destination ranges:

            $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --destination-ranges

     [1m--priority[m=[4mPRIORITY[m
        This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both inclusive. When NOT
        specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative priority determines
        precedence of conflicting rules: lower priority values imply higher
        precedence. DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules having equal
        priority.

     [1m--rules[m=[[4mPROTOCOL[m[:[4mPORT[m[-[4mPORT[m]],...]
        A list of protocols and ports to which the firewall rule will apply.

        PROTOCOL is the IP protocol whose traffic will be checked. PROTOCOL can
        be either the name of a well-known protocol (e.g., tcp or icmp) or the
        IP protocol number. A list of IP protocols can be found at
        http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml

        A port or port range can be specified after PROTOCOL to which the
        firewall rule apply on traffic through specific ports. If no port or
        port range is specified, connections through all ranges are applied.
        TCP and UDP rules must include a port or port range.

        Setting this will override the current values.

     [1m--source-ranges[m=[[4mCIDR_RANGE[m,...]
        A list of IP address blocks that are allowed to make inbound
        connections that match the firewall rule to the instances on the
        network. The IP address blocks must be specified in CIDR format:
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing.

        If neither --source-ranges nor --source-tags are specified,
        --source-ranges defaults to [1m0.0.0.0/0[m, which means that the rule
        applies to all incoming connections from inside or outside the network.
        If both --source-ranges and --source-tags are specified, the rule
        matches if either the range of the source matches --source-ranges or
        the tag of the source matches --source-tags.

        Setting this will override the existing source ranges for the firewall.
        The following will clear the existing source ranges:

            $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --source-ranges

     [1m--source-service-accounts[m=[[4mEMAIL[m,...]
        The email of a service account indicating the set of instances on the
        network which match a traffic source in the firewall rule.

        If a source service account is specified then neither source tags nor
        target tags can also be specified.

        Setting this will override the existing source service accounts for the
        firewall. The following will clear the existing source service
        accounts:

            $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE \
                --source-service-accounts

     [1m--source-tags[m=[[4mTAG[m,...]
        A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the network
        to which the rule applies if all other fields match. If neither
        --source-ranges nor --source-tags are specified, --source-ranges
        defaults to [1m0.0.0.0/0[m, which means that the rule applies to all
        incoming connections from inside or outside the network.

        If both --source-ranges and --source-tags are specified, an inbound
        connection is allowed if either the range of the source matches
        --source-ranges or the tag of the source matches --source-tags.

        Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation.

        If source tags are specified then neither a source nor target service
        account can also be specified.

        Setting this will override the existing source tags for the firewall.
        The following will clear the existing source tags:

            $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --source-tags

     [1m--target-service-accounts[m=[[4mEMAIL[m,...]
        The email of a service account indicating the set of instances to which
        firewall rules apply. If both target tags and target service account
        are omitted, the firewall rule is applied to all instances on the
        network.

        If a target service account is specified then neither source tag nor
        target tags can also be specified.

        Setting this will override the existing target service accounts for the
        firewall. The following will clear the existing target service
        accounts:

            $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE \
                --target-service-accounts

     [1m--target-tags[m=[[4mTAG[m,...]
        A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the network
        which may accept inbound connections that match the firewall rule. If
        both target tags and target service account are omitted, all instances
        on the network can receive inbound connections that match the rule.

        Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation.

        If target tags are specified then neither a source nor target service
        account can also be specified.

        Setting this will override the existing target tags for the firewall.
        The following will clear the existing target tags:

            $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --target-tags
